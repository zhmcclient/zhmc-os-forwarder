The **IBM Z HMC OS Message Forwarder** connects to the console of operating
systems running in LPARs on Z systems and forwards the messages written by the
operating system to its console to a remote syslog server.

The Z systems can be in classic or DPM operatonal mode.

.. # The forwarder attempts to stay up as much as possible, for example it performs
.. # automatic session renewals with the HMC if the logon session expires, and it
.. # survives HMC reboots and automatically picks up message forwarding at the
.. # right message sequence number once the HMC come back up.

Documentation

.. _Change log: https://zhmc-os-forwarder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changes.html

Quickstart
----------

* Install the forwarder and all of its Python dependencies as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install zhmc-os-forwarder

* Provide a config file for use by the forwarder.

  The config file tells the forwarder which HMC to use, and for which CPCs
  and partitions it should forward to which syslog servers.

  Download the `example config file`_ as ``config.yaml`` and edit that copy
  according to your environment.

.. # For details, see `forwarder config file`_.

.. _forwarder config file: https://zhmc-os-forwarder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#hmc-credentials-file
.. _example config file: examples/config_example.yaml

* Run the forwarder as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ zhmc_os_forwarder -c config.yaml

Limitations
-----------

At this point, the forwarder has several limitations. All of them are intended
to be resolved in future releases.

* The forwarder does not recover from HMC restart or connection loss
* Restarting the forwarder will send again all OS messages the HMC has buffered
* New and deleted partitions in DPM mode are not automatically detected.
* No documentation
