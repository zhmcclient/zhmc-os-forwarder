Development
===========

This page covers the relevant aspects for developers.

Repository
----------

The Git repository for the forwarder project is GitHub:
https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-os-forwarder

Code of Conduct
---------------

Contribution must follow the `Code of Conduct as defined by the Contributor Covenant`_.

.. _Code of Conduct as defined by the Contributor Covenant: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct

Contributing
------------

Third party contributions to this project are welcome!

In order to contribute, create a `Git pull request`_, considering this:

.. _Git pull request: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

* Test is required.
* Each commit should only contain one "logical" change.
* A "logical" change should be put into one commit, and not split over multiple
  commits.
* Large new features should be split into stages.
* The commit message should not only summarize what you have done, but explain
  why the change is useful.
* The commit message must follow the format explained below.

What comprises a "logical" change is subject to sound judgement. Sometimes, it
makes sense to produce a set of commits for a feature (even if not large). For
example, a first commit may introduce a (presumably) compatible API change
without exploitation of that feature. With only this commit applied, it should
be demonstrable that everything is still working as before. The next commit may
be the exploitation of the feature in other components.

For further discussion of good and bad practices regarding commits, see:

* `OpenStack Git Commit Good Practice`_
* `How to Get Your Change Into the Linux Kernel`_

.. _OpenStack Git Commit Good Practice: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages
.. _How to Get Your Change Into the Linux Kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Format of commit messages
-------------------------

A commit message must start with a short summary line, followed by a blank line.

Optionally, the summary line may start with an identifier that helps identifying
the type of change or the component that is affected, followed by a colon.

It can include a more detailed description after the summary line. This is where
you explain why the change was done, and summarize what was done.

It must end with the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sign-off line in the
format shown in the example below, using your name and a valid email address of
yours. The DCO sign-off line certifies that you followed the rules stated in
`DCO 1.1`_. In short, you certify that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the
right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

.. _DCO 1.1: https://developercertificate.org/

All lines in the commit messages must not be longer than 80 characters.

We check in the test workflow whether the commit messages in the pull request
comply to this format. If the commit messages do not comply, the test workflow
will fail.

Example commit message:

.. code-block:: text

    cookies: Add support for delivering cookies

    Cookies are important for many people. This change adds a pluggable API for
    delivering cookies to the user, and provides a default implementation.

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>

Use ``git commit --amend`` to edit the commit message, if you need to.

Use the ``--signoff`` (``-s``) option of ``git commit`` to append a sign-off
line to the commit message with your name and email as known by Git.

If you like filling out the commit message in an editor instead of using the
``-m`` option of ``git commit``, you can automate the presence of the sign-off
line by using a commit template file:

* Create a file outside of the repo (say, ``~/.git-signoff.template``)
  that contains, for example:

  .. code-block:: text

      <one-line subject>

      <detailed description>

      Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>

* Configure Git to use that file as a commit template for your repo:

  .. code-block:: text

      git config commit.template ~/.git-signoff.template

Releasing a version
-------------------

This section shows the steps for releasing a version to `PyPI`_.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/

It covers all variants of versions that can be released:

* Releasing a new major version (Mnew.0.0) based on the master branch
* Releasing a new minor version (M.Nnew.0) based on the master branch or based
  on an earlier stable branch
* Releasing a new update version (M.N.Unew) based on the stable branch of its
  minor version

This description assumes that you are authorized to push to the remote repo
at https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-os-forwarder and that the remote repo
has the remote name ``origin`` in your local clone.

Any commands in the following steps are executed in the main directory of your
local clone of the zhmc-os-forwarder Git repo.

1.  On GitHub, verify open items in milestone ``M.N.U``.

    Verify that milestone ``M.N.U`` has no open issues or PRs anymore. If there
    are open PRs or open issues, make a decision for each of those whether or
    not it should go into version ``M.N.U`` you are about to release.

    If there are open issues or PRs that should go into this version, abandon
    the release process.

    If none of the open issues or PRs should go into this version, change their
    milestones to a future version, and proceed with the release process. You
    may need to create the milestone for the future version.

2.  Run the Safety tool:

    .. code-block:: sh

        make safety

    If any of the two safety runs fails, fix the safety issues that are reported,
    in a separate branch/PR.

    Roll back the PR into any maintained stable branches.

3.  Check for any
    `dependabot alerts <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-os-forwarder/security/dependabot>`_.

    If there are any dependabot alerts, fix them in a separate branch/PR.

    Roll back the PR into any maintained stable branches.

4.  Create and push the release branch (replace M,N,U accordingly):

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.U make release_branch

    This uses the default branch determined from ``VERSION``: For ``M.N.0``,
    the ``master`` branch is used, otherwise the ``stable_M.N`` branch is used.
    That covers for all cases except if you want to release a new minor version
    based on an earlier stable branch. In that case, you need to specify that
    branch:

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.0 BRANCH=stable_M.N make release_branch

    This includes the following steps:

    * create the release branch (``release_M.N.U``), if not yet existing
    * make sure the AUTHORS.md file is up to date
    * update the change log from the change fragment files, and delete those
    * commit the changes to the release branch
    * push the release branch

    If this command fails, the fix can be committed to the release branch
    and the command above can be retried.

5.  On GitHub, create a Pull Request for branch ``release_M.N.U``.

    Important: When creating Pull Requests, GitHub by default targets the
    ``master`` branch. When releasing based on a stable branch, you need to
    change the target branch of the Pull Request to ``stable_M.N``.

    Set the milestone of that PR to version ``M.N.U``.

    This PR should normally be set to be reviewed by at least one of the
    maintainers.

    The PR creation will cause the "test" workflow to run. That workflow runs
    tests for all defined environments, since it discovers by the branch name
    that this is a PR for a release.

6.  On GitHub, once the checks for that Pull Request have succeeded, merge the
    Pull Request (no review is needed). This automatically deletes the branch
    on GitHub.

    If the PR did not succeed, fix the issues.

7.  On GitHub, close milestone ``M.N.U``.

    Verify that the milestone has no open items anymore. If it does have open
    items, investigate why and fix (probably step 1 was not performed).

8.  Publish the package (replace M,N,U accordingly):

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.U make release_publish

    or (see step 4):

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.0 BRANCH=stable_M.N make release_publish

    This includes the following steps:

    * create and push the release tag
    * clean up the release branch

    Pushing the release tag will cause the "publish" workflow to run. That workflow
    builds the package, publishes it on PyPI, creates a release for it on
    GitHub, and finally creates a new stable branch on GitHub if the master
    branch was released.

9.  Verify the publishing

    Wait for the "publish" workflow for the new release to have completed:
    https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-os-forwarder/actions/workflows/publish.yml

    Then, perform the following verifications:

    * Verify that the new version is available on PyPI at
      https://pypi.org/project/zhmc-os-forwarder/

    * Verify that the new version has a release on Github at
      https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-os-forwarder/releases

    * Verify that the new version has documentation on ReadTheDocs at
      https://zhmc-os-forwarder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html

      The new version ``M.N.U`` should be automatically active on ReadTheDocs,
      causing the documentation for the new version to be automatically
      built and published.

      If you cannot see the new version after some minutes, log in to
      https://readthedocs.org/projects/zhmc-os-forwarder/versions/
      and activate the new version.


Starting a new version
----------------------

This section shows the steps for starting development of a new version.

This section covers all variants of new versions:

* Starting a new major version (Mnew.0.0) based on the master branch
* Starting a new minor version (M.Nnew.0) based on the master branch
* Starting a new update version (M.N.Unew) based on the stable branch of its
  minor version

This description assumes that you are authorized to push to the remote repo
at https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-os-forwarder and that the remote repo
has the remote name ``origin`` in your local clone.

Any commands in the following steps are executed in the main directory of your
local clone of the zhmc-os-forwarder Git repo.

1.  Create and push the start branch (replace M,N,U accordingly):

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.U make start_branch

    This uses the default branch determined from ``VERSION``: For ``M.N.0``,
    the ``master`` branch is used, otherwise the ``stable_M.N`` branch is used.
    That covers for all cases except if you want to start a new minor version
    based on an earlier stable branch. In that case, you need to specify that
    branch:

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.0 BRANCH=stable_M.N make start_branch

    This includes the following steps:

    * create the start branch (``start_M.N.U``), if not yet existing
    * create a dummy change
    * commit and push the start branch (``start_M.N.U``)

2.  On GitHub, create a milestone for the new version ``M.N.U``.

    You can create a milestone in GitHub via Issues -> Milestones -> New
    Milestone.

3.  On GitHub, create a Pull Request for branch ``start_M.N.U``.

    Important: When creating Pull Requests, GitHub by default targets the
    ``master`` branch. When starting a version based on a stable branch, you
    need to change the target branch of the Pull Request to ``stable_M.N``.

    No review is needed for this PR.

    Set the milestone of that PR to the new version ``M.N.U``.

4.  On GitHub, go through all open issues and pull requests that still have
    milestones for previous releases set, and either set them to the new
    milestone, or to have no milestone.

    Note that when the release process has been performed as described, there
    should not be any such issues or pull requests anymore. So this step here
    is just an additional safeguard.

5.  On GitHub, once the checks for the Pull Request for branch ``start_M.N.U``
    have succeeded, merge the Pull Request (no review is needed). This
    automatically deletes the branch on GitHub.

6.  Update and clean up the local repo (replace M,N,U accordingly):

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.U make start_tag

    or (see step 1):

    .. code-block:: sh

        VERSION=M.N.0 BRANCH=stable_M.N make start_tag

    This includes the following steps:

    * checkout and pull the branch that was started (``master`` or ``stable_M.N``)
    * delete the start branch (``start_M.N.U``) locally and remotely
    * create and push the start tag (``M.N.Ua0``)


Building the distribution archives
----------------------------------

You can build a binary (wheel) distribution archive and a source distribution
archive (a more minimal version of the repository) with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make build

You will find the files ``zhmc_os_forwarder-VERSION_NUMBER-py2.py3-none-any.whl``
and ``zhmc_os_forwarder-VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz`` in the ``dist`` folder,
the former being the binary and the latter being the source distribution archive.

The binary distribution archive could be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install zhmc_os_forwarder-VERSION_NUMBER-py2.py3-none-any.whl

The source distribution archive could be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tar -xfz zhmc_os_forwarder-VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz
  $ pip install zhmc_os_forwarder-VERSION_NUMBER

Building the documentation
--------------------------

You can build the HTML documentation with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make builddoc

The root file for the built documentation will be ``build_docs/index.html``.

Testing
-------

You can perform unit tests with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make test

You can perform a flake8 check with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make check

You can perform a pylint check with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make pylint
